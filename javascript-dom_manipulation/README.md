# JavaScript - DOM Manipulation

This project focuses on manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. The goal is to dynamically interact with HTML elements, handle events, and fetch data using the Fetch API.

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I was able to:

- Select HTML elements using JavaScript (`querySelector`, `getElementById`, etc.)
- Differentiate between ID, class, and tag selectors
- Modify element styles and content
- Add, remove, and toggle HTML classes
- Append and manipulate elements in the DOM
- Use event listeners to bind actions to user events
- Perform HTTP requests using the Fetch API
- Handle asynchronous behavior with Promises

## üìù Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-script.js` | Changes header text color to red |
| `1-script.js` | Changes header color on click |
| `2-script.js` | Adds `.red` class to header on click |
| `3-script.js` | Toggles between `.red` and `.green` classes on header |
| `4-script.js` | Adds `<li>Item</li>` to a list on click |
| `5-script.js` | Changes header text to "New Header!!!" on click |
| `6-script.js` | Fetches and displays a Star Wars character |
| `7-script.js` | Fetches and displays a list of Star Wars movies |
| `8-script.js` | Fetches and displays the word "Hello" in French using an external API |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- JavaScript (ES6)
- HTML5
- Fetch API
- Chrome browser
- No external libraries (pure JS)

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- All scripts must be `semistandard` compliant
- No use of `var` (only `const` and `let`)
- Scripts must not cause page reloads
- DOM manipulations should be dynamic and responsive
